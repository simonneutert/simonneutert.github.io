This blog is about my journey as a software developer, sharing insights, tips,
and experiences from the world of coding and technology.

I share my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/simonneutert) and I sometimes
[blog](/posts.html) about what made me smile, stumble, humble, or moan.

My GitHub stars can be browsed [here](/starred-repos.html), they're
automatically updated weekly using
[deno-starshower](https://github.com/simonneutert/deno-starshower).

I help maintain [shell-curry](https://shell-curry.simon-neutert.de/), an
opinionated list of terminal tools.

Check out my [MicroBlog, here on the website](/microblog.html),\
where I collect and share links I find interesting.

My passion is Ruby, yet I enjoy exploring what other languages bring to the
table. I've been dabbling with Clojure, exploring the
[land of LISP and parentheses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HM1Zb3xmvMc&t=64s)
whenever I find the time 🥰

I share my photos on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/simonneutert/).

Get in touch with me @[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simon-neutert/)! 🍻

## I blog from time to time

Mostly about code I've written, sometimes pet projects, or things that should
never slow me down again.

I run website/blog with my custom static site generator, written mostly in
TypeScript with [Deno](https://deno.land/) as the runtime/ecosystem.\
The source code is available on GitHub:
[@simonneutert/deno-quickblog](https://github.com/simonneutert/deno-quickblog).
