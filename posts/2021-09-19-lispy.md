I currently read the infamous book "The Land of Lisp"
[http://landoflisp.com](http://landoflisp.com) written by Conrad Barski. As a
Ruby developer it had me hooked in no time. Fast forward some google searches,
blog posts and YouTube videos, I landed with Clojure/ClojureScript.

After having written much Javascript in the past 2 years, lots of struggle with
tech stack churn, I was watching this video today:

Create a form using ClojureScript and Re-Frame\

followed by this one:

"ClojureScript in the Age of TypeScript" by David Nolen\

When one starts digging the web for LISP, you will definitely read something
like: "Even if you never use it, learning a little LISP is a reward itself." and
to be honest, well they are right. It is fun, challenging and very, very
rewarding.

I am not yet able to share a little project at this point in time, but this blog
post is more of a reminder, that should keep me digging deeper, practising my
lisp and finally come out of my cave with a pizza pi calculator written in
ClojureScript/re-frame 🥰
