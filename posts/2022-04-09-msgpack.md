So in order to get a feel for the Wunderkind in tech land, I set up a simple
demo of an emitter and a consuming backend using MsgPack.

A backend serializes a tiny and a huge Ruby Hash using MsgPack. The generated
code is then sent over the internets (it's someone's localhost, mine 🤫) to the
requesting program, which is a simple NodeJS script https-requesting the MsgPack
payload.

[You can check out the projet on github!](https://github.com/simonneutert/msgpack-demo)

_**Spoiler**: gzipped json is good enough_
