## TL;DR<!-- omit in toc -->

- **Give back**—with money (even $1 helps), time, or skills.
- **Limit corporate influence.** If _we_ fund projects, _coporate_ control is
  limited.
- **Your donation isn’t just cash—it’s proof that someone cares.**
- **Pick one project you rely on and set up a donation today.**

### Why am I writing this post?

Christmas is that rare time when we pause—when the year’s chaos slows just
enough to reflect, celebrate, or reset. For many of us, it’s also when we
realize how much we owe to things we take for granted.

Like open-source software.

Think about the tools you use daily: the Linux server hosting your favorite
site, the tiny npm package that saved you hours, the text editor that’s become
an extension of your thoughts. Someone wrote that. Someone maintains it. **And
most of them do it for free.**

I’ve been on both sides of this. I’ve used free software without a second
thought, and I’ve stayed up late fixing bugs in projects no one pays me for.
Here’s the truth: **Open source isn’t free. It’s a gift.** And gifts deserve
gratitude.

For some odd reason I don’t quite remember, I read
[this GitHub discussion (PrawnPDF)](https://github.com/orgs/prawnpdf/discussions/1386),
and it sparked a snowball of thoughts over the past few weeks.

### Why this matters for all of us

We developers are lucky. Despite the noise about AI replacing us or "10x
engineers" hogging the spotlight, we’re still needed. Hell, we’re needed _more
than ever_—because the world runs on people, either writing code or overseeing
the systems that do.

Here are some heavyweights we all have heard of:

- The **Linux and BSD kernels** powering your internet.
- The **web servers and proxies** serving your data.
- The **email client** (like Thunderbird) you rely on.

These things don’t materialize out of thin air. They’re built by people who
_could_ be doing paid work instead. **They’re acts of generosity.**

### How to give back (without overthinking it)

You don’t need to be rich or a corporate sponsor. You just need to **pick one
project and act**.

#### 1. **Money (the fastest way to say "Thank You")**

Most of us can spare $5 or $10. That’s not much to you, but to a maintainer,
it’s:

- A cup of coffee to fuel an after-work debug session.
- The slice of pizza that sparks joy.
- Proof that someone _notices_ their work.
- Motivation to keep going, even when it feels pointless.

**Where to start?**

- [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors) (one-time or recurring).
- [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/) (for teams/projects).
- A project’s Patreon or PayPal (check their README).

**Are you lazy?** Set up a **yearly donation** now—future you won’t even miss
it.

#### 2. **Time or skills (if money’s tight)**

- **Get in touch.** Offer help.
- **Fix a bug.** Even a typo in the docs helps.
- **Answer questions** in forums or GitHub issues.
- **Write a thank-you email.** Seriously. Maintainers remember those.

#### 3. **Spread the word**

- Star the repo. Tweet about it. Tell a friend.
- **Visibility = sustainability.**

### The ripple effect

Here’s what happens when you donate:

1. A maintainer sees your name and thinks, _"Someone gives a damn."_
2. They fix one more bug, write one more test, or—just as important—**don’t lose
   their spark of joy.**
3. The project stays alive. Your tools stay free. The cycle continues.

This isn’t charity. **It’s mutualism.**\
You’re not just giving back—you’re **investing in the infrastructure of your own
work.**

### My ask

This holiday, **pick one project you rely on and give something back.** Not next
year. Not when you’re "less busy." Now.

I donated to:

- **[kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)** (my daily terminal emulator).
- **[Let’s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)** (because without it, I wouldn’t
  host _anything_).

**What’s yours?**

### A personal note

This year was a big one for me: I switched _mostly_ from macOS to give
**[Bazzite](https://bazzite.gg/)** and Fedora a shot. It turned out to be a huge
success and introduced me to a ton of new, free software I now rely on:

- **[fish shell](https://fishshell.com/)**
- **[distrobox](https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox)**
- **[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)** (omnipresent on
  Linux—[donations welcome](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew?tab=readme-ov-file#donations))
- **[Neovim](https://neovim.io/)** + **[LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/)**
- (And a bunch of others we’re collecting on
  **[shell-curry](https://shell-curry.simon-neutert.de/)**)

I’ll be donating to more of these over the next year. Of course,
**[Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/)** gets its annual tip! And
**[OpenFreeMap](https://openfreemap.org/)**, I love you.
