Deno is all the rage these days — and for good reason!

After building a basic interactive CLI app with [Deno](https://deno.com), I
wanted to try creating a simple web app.

For this project, I decided to use [Oak](https://oakserver.org) as the web
framework. Don’t ask me why I chose [HandlebarsJS](https://handlebarsjs.com) for
templating - I just Googled “Handlebars with Oak” and started building. 🤷‍♂️

## What I Wanted to Achieve

The app is designed for outdoor enthusiasts to “collect” map tiles/areas. My
goals included:

- Rendering a mapbox map.
- Allowing users to click on the map to add/remove a square.
- Using a JSON file as the database.
  - Preloaded with areas that are inaccessible to the public.
- Enabling data export in JSON format.

## Lessons Learned

This was a rewarding (and sometimes unexpected) learning experience. 🥲

### Genesis

The proof-of-concept app came together quickly. I used Node’s `http-server` to
serve static files, along with a simple `.html` file, Bootstrap, `mapbox GL JS`,
and vanilla JavaScript.

#### Example Oak Route

Here's a simple Oak route handler:

```ts
import { Application, Router } from "https://deno.land/x/oak/mod.ts";
const router = new Router();
router.get("/", (context) => {
  context.response.body = "Hello from Oak!";
});
const app = new Application();
app.use(router.routes());
app.use(router.allowedMethods());
await app.listen({ port: 8000 });
```

### Challenges

Making this a public, hostable project required some changes:

- Tracking the API key in plain HTML 😵‍💫 was a no-go.
- The app was a single file. Not very maintainable.
- Privacy concerns with CDNs required user consent before loading resources.

### Choosing Deno and Oak

I knew Deno was the way forward, but finding the right framework took time.
Based on my experience with Express and Fastify, I wanted a lightweight
alternative.

[Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev) seemed promising but felt like overkill. Deno’s
documentation then suggested:

> We recommend `oak` as a middleware framework for Deno.

Setting up Oak for a "hello world" app was straightforward. But I needed a
templating engine. Should I use `ejs`, `pug`, or `handlebars`? 🤔 For reasons I
can’t fully recall, I went with Handlebars, and after some trial and error,
things started rendering.

I kept the JavaScript vanilla, avoiding bundlers and transpilers—just plain JS
and MDN as my guide.

### Building and Deploying

The app started to come together: I added vendor CSS/JS files, served static
files via Oak, and implemented basic cookie logic for external resources
(mapbox). Now, users need to confirm external resource use to access the app.

Finally, I dockerized it, wrote a README, and pushed everything to GitHub.

## Wrap-Up

Deno was a joy to work with, though Oak’s documentation felt a bit sparse. The
examples were helpful, but I needed some extra resources to understand it fully.

Handlebars… it’s aptly named; it was a bit "hairy" to navigate without
StackOverflow. For example, getting partials and helpers working took some trial
and error, and the documentation was sometimes sparse.

I learned `deno serve --parallel` would utilize all cores for maximum
throughput. 🚀

All in all, I’m happy with the result. The app is simple but effective. It lacks
tests, but given the limited feature set, I learned a lot along the way. If I
were to expand it, I'd add tests for the API endpoints, map interactions, and
data export logic.

## What Would I Do Differently?

Next time, I might try [Hono](https://hono.dev/) as the backend solution and
consider JSX for templating, as Hono supports it natively.
