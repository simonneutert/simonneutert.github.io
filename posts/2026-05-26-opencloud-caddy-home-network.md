title: "Setting up OpenCloud with Caddy in my home network"
layout: post
---

Setting up OpenCloud in my home network was a learning experience. I wanted a
simple, private installation using local DNS and self-signed certificates.
Here's how I did it with Pi-hole and Caddy.

## Prerequisites

- Pi-hole (bare-metal) with DNS configuration access
- Docker and Docker Compose
- 10+ GB disk space
- 4-8 GB RAM

## Overview

This setup uses:

- **Pi-hole** for local DNS routing
- **Caddy** as a reverse proxy handling SSL/TLS on ports 80/443
- **OpenCloud** running in Docker

## Step 1: Configure Pi-hole

Since Caddy needs ports 80 and 443, move Pi-hole to port 8080.

Edit `/etc/pihole/pihole-FTL.conf`:

```conf
port = "8080o,[::]:8080o"
```

Reboot the machine.

## Step 2: Set Up OpenCloud

### Clone and Configure

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/opencloud-eu/opencloud-compose.git
cd opencloud-compose
cp .env.example .env
```

### Configure Environment

Edit `.env` and update these critical paths (replace `bedman` with your
username):

```env
OC_CONFIG_DIR=/home/bedman/opencloud/config
OC_DATA_DIR=/home/bedman/opencloud/data
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Please change passwords, if this is not a test installation!

Key settings in my `.env`:

```env
## Basic Settings ##
# Define the docker compose log driver used.
# Defaults to local
LOG_DRIVER=
# If you're on an internet facing server, comment out following line.
# It skips certificate validation for various parts of OpenCloud and is
# needed when self signed certificates are used.
INSECURE=true

## Features ##
# The following variable is a convenience variable to enable or disable features of this compose project.
# Example: if you want to use traefik and letsencrypt, you can set the variable to
#COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml:traefik/opencloud.yml
# This enables you to just run `docker compose up -d` and the compose files will be added to the stack.
# As alternative approach you can run `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.traefik.yml up -d`
# Default: OpenCloud and Collabora with traefik and letsencypt
# This needs DNS entries for the domain names used in the .env file.
#COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml:weboffice/collabora.yml:traefik/opencloud.yml:traefik/collabora.yml
# If you want to use the external proxy, you can use the following combination.
# DNS entries and certificates need to be managed by the external environment.
# The domain names need to be entered into the .env file.
COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml:weboffice/collabora.yml:external-proxy/opencloud.yml:external-proxy/collabora.yml:antivirus/clamav.yml:radicale/radicale.yml:search/tika.yml
# Keycloak Shared User Directory
#COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml:weboffice/collabora.yml:traefik/opencloud.yml:traefik/collabora.yml:idm/ldap-keycloak.yml:traefik/ldap-keycloak.yml

## Traefik Settings ##
# Note: Traefik is always enabled and can't be disabled.
# Serve Traefik dashboard.
# Defaults to "false".
TRAEFIK_DASHBOARD=
# Domain of Traefik, where you can find the dashboard.
# Defaults to "traefik.opencloud.test"
TRAEFIK_DOMAIN=
# Basic authentication for the traefik dashboard.
# Defaults to user "admin" and password "admin" (written as: "admin:$2y$05$KDHu3xq92SPaO3G8Ybkc7edd51pPLJcG1nWk3lmlrIdANQ/B6r5pq").
# To create user:password pair, it's possible to use this command:
# echo $(htpasswd -nB user) | sed -e s/\\$/\\$\\$/g
TRAEFIK_BASIC_AUTH_USERS=
# Email address for obtaining LetsEncrypt certificates.
# Needs only be changed if this is a public facing server.
TRAEFIK_ACME_MAIL=
# Set to the following for testing to check the certificate process:
# "https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory"
# With staging configured, there will be an SSL error in the browser.
# When certificates are displayed and are emitted by # "Fake LE Intermediate X1",
# the process went well and the envvar can be reset to empty to get valid certificates.
TRAEFIK_ACME_CASERVER=
# Enable the Traefik ACME (Automatic Certificate Management Environment) for automatic SSL certificate management.
TRAEFIK_SERVICES_TLS_CONFIG="tls.certresolver=letsencrypt"
# Enable Traefik to use local certificates.
#TRAEFIK_SERVICES_TLS_CONFIG="tls=true"
# You also need to provide a config file in ./config/traefik/dynamic/certs.yml
# Example:
# cat ./config/traefik/dynamic/certs.yml
# tls:
#   certificates:
#     - certFile: /certs/opencloud.test.crt
#       keyFile: /certs/opencloud.test.key
#       stores:
#         - default
#
# The certificates need to be copied into ./certs/, the absolute path inside the container is /certs/.
# You can also use TRAEFIK_CERTS_DIR=/path/on/host to set the path to the certificates directory.
# Enable the access log for Traefik by setting the following variable to true.
TRAEFIK_ACCESS_LOG=
# Configure the log level for Traefik.
# Possible values are "TRACE", "DEBUG", "INFO", "WARN", "ERROR", "FATAL" and "PANIC". Default is "ERROR".
TRAEFIK_LOG_LEVEL=


## OpenCloud Settings ##

# Demo users should not be created on a production instance,
# because their passwords are public. Defaults to "false".
# If demo users is set to "true", the following user accounts are created automatically:
# alan, mary, margaret, dennis and lynn - the password is 'demo' for all.
DEMO_USERS=
# Admin Password for the OpenCloud admin user.
# NOTE: This is only needed when using the built-in LDAP server (idm).
# If you are using an external LDAP server, the admin password is managed by the LDAP server.
# NOTE: This variable needs to be set before the first start of OpenCloud. Changes to this variable after the first start will be IGNORED.
# If not set, opencloud will not work properly. The container will be restarting.
# After the first initialization, the admin password can only be changed via the OpenCloud User Settings UI or by using the OpenCloud CLI.
# Documentation: https://docs.opencloud.eu/docs/admin/resources/common-issues#-change-admin-password-set-in-env
INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin
# Define the openCloud loglevel used.
#
LOG_LEVEL=
# Define the kind of logging.
# The default log can be read by machines.
# Set this to true to make the log human readable.
# LOG_PRETTY=true
#
# Define the openCloud storage location. Set the paths for config and data to a local path.
# Ensure that the configuration and data directories are owned by the user and group with ID 1000:1000.
# This matches the default user inside the container and avoids permission issues when accessing files.
# Note that especially the data directory can grow big.
# Leaving it default stores data in docker internal volumes.
OC_CONFIG_DIR=/home/bedman/opencloud/config
OC_DATA_DIR=/home/bedman/opencloud/data
# OpenCloud Web can load extensions from a leberwurst directory.
# The default uses the bind mount to the config/opencloud/apps directory.
# Example: curl -L https://github.com/opencloud-eu/web-extensions/releases/download/unzip-v1.0.2/unzip-1.0.2.zip | tar -xz -C config/opencloud/apps
# NOTE: you need to restart the openCloud container to load the new extensions.

# Define the ldap-server storage location. Set the paths for config and data to a local path.
# LDAP_CERTS_DIR=
# LDAP_DATA_DIR=

# S3 Storage configuration - optional
# OpenCloud supports S3 storage as primary storage.
# Per default, S3 storage is disabled and the decomposed storage driver is used.
# To enable S3 storage, add `storage/decomposeds3.yml` to the COMPOSE_FILE variable or to
# your startup command (`docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f storage/decomposeds3.yml up`).
#
# Configure the S3 storage endpoint. Defaults to "http://minio:9000" for testing purposes.
DECOMPOSEDS3_ENDPOINT=

DECOMPOSEDS3_BUCKET=


# Define SMTP settings if you would like to send OpenCloud email notifications.
# To actually send notifications, you also need to enable the 'notifications' service
# by adding it to the START_ADDITIONAL_SERVICES variable below.
#
# NOTE: when configuring Inbucket, these settings have no effect, see inbucket.yml for details.
# SMTP host to connect to.
SMTP_HOST=
# Port of the SMTP host to connect to.

# Additional services to be started on opencloud startup
# The following list of services is not started automatically and must be
# manually defined for startup:
# IMPORTANT: Add any services to the startup list comma separated like "notifications,antivirus" etc.
START_ADDITIONAL_SERVICES="antivirus,radicale,search"


## Default Enabled Services ##

### Apache Tika Content Analysis Toolkit ###
# Tika (search) is disabled by default due to performance reasons.
# Tika is used to extract metadata and text from various file formats.
# Enable it by adding the following to the COMPOSE_FILE variable:
# search/tika.yml or by using the following command:
# docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f search/tika.yml up -d
# Set the desired docker image tag or digest.
# Defaults to "apache/tika:latest-full"
TIKA_IMAGE=

### IMPORTANT Note for Online Office Apps ###
# To avoid app interlocking issues, you should select only one app to be active/configured.
# This is due the fact that there is currently no app interlocking for the same file and one
# has to wait for a lock release to open the file with another app.

### Collabora Settings ###
# Domain of Collabora, where you can find the frontend.
# Defaults to "collabora.opencloud.test"
COLLABORA_DOMAIN=
# Domain of the wopiserver which handles Collabora.
# Defaults to "wopiserver.opencloud.test"
WOPISERVER_DOMAIN=
# Admin user for Collabora.
# Defaults to "admin".
# Collabora Admin Panel URL:
# https://{COLLABORA_DOMAIN}/browser/dist/admin/admin.html
COLLABORA_ADMIN_USER=
# Admin password for Collabora.
# Defaults to "admin".
COLLABORA_ADMIN_PASSWORD=
# Set to true to enable SSL handling in Collabora Online, this is only required if you are not using a reverse proxy.
# Default is true if not specified.
COLLABORA_SSL_ENABLE=false
# If you're on an internet-facing server, enable SSL verification for Collabora Online.
# Please comment out the following line:
COLLABORA_SSL_VERIFICATION=false
# Enable home mode in Collabore Online.
# Home users can enable this setting, which in turn disables welcome screen and user feedback popups, 
# but also limits concurrent open connections to 20 and concurrent open documents to 10.
# Default is false if not specified.
COLLABORA_HOME_MODE=


### Virusscanner Settings ###
# IMPORTANT: If you enable antivirus, you also MUST configure the START_ADDITIONAL_SERVICES
# envvar in the OpenCloud Settings above by adding 'antivirus' to the list.
# The maximum scan size the virus scanner can handle, needs adjustment in the scanner config as well:
# For ClamAV, set CLAMD_CONF_StreamMaxLength in antivirus/clamav.yml to the same or a higher value.
# Usable common abbreviations: [KB, KiB, MB, MiB, GB, GiB, TB, TiB, PB, PiB, EB, EiB], example: 2GB.
# Defaults to "100MB"
#ANTIVIRUS_MAX_SCAN_SIZE=
# Usable modes: partial, skip.
# Defaults to "partial"
#ANTIVIRUS_MAX_SCAN_SIZE_MODE=
# Image version of the ClamAV container.
# Defaults to "latest"
CLAMAV_DOCKER_TAG=


### Inbucket Settings ###
# Inbucket is a mail catcher tool for testing purposes.
# DO NOT use in Production.
# email server (in this case inbucket acts as mail catcher).
# Domain for Inbucket. Defaults to "mail.opencloud.test".
INBUCKET_DOMAIN=


### Compose Configuration ###
# Path separator for supplemental compose files specified in COMPOSE_FILE.
COMPOSE_PATH_SEPARATOR=:

### Ldap Settings ###
# LDAP is always needed for OpenCloud to store user data as there is no relational database.
# The built-in LDAP server should used for testing purposes or small installations only.
# For production installations, it is recommended to use an external LDAP server.
# We are using OpenLDAP as the default LDAP server because it is proven to be stable and reliable.
# This LDAP configuration is known to work with OpenCloud and provides a blueprint for
# configuring an external LDAP server based on other products like Microsoft Active Directory or other LDAP servers.
#
# Password of LDAP bind user "cn=admin,dc=opencloud,dc=eu". Defaults to "admin"
LDAP_BIND_PASSWORD=
# The LDAP server also creates an openCloud admin user dn: uid=admin,ou=users,dc=opencloud,dc=eu
# The initial password for this user is "admin"
# NOTE: This password can only be set once, if you want to change it later, you have to use the OpenCloud User Settings UI.
# If you changed the password and lost it, you need to execute the following LDAP query to reset it:
# enter the ldap-server container with `docker compose exec ldap-server sh`
# and run the following command to change the password:
# ldappasswd -H ldap://127.0.0.1:1389 -D "cn=admin,dc=opencloud,dc=eu" -W "uid=admin,ou=users,dc=opencloud,dc=eu"
# You will be prompted for the LDAP bind password.
# The output should provide you a new password for the admin user.


### Keycloak Settings ###
# Keycloak is an open-source identity and access management solution.
# We are using Keycloak as the default identity provider on production installations.
# It can be used to federate authentication with other identity providers like
# Microsoft Entra ID, ADFS or other SAML/OIDC providers.
# The use of Keycloak as bridge between OpenCloud and other identity providers creates more control over the
# authentication process, the allowed clients and the session management.
# Keycloak also manages the Role Based Access Control (RBAC) for OpenCloud.
# Keycloak can be used in two different modes:
# 1. Autoprovisioning: New users are automatically created in openCloud when they log in for the first time.
# 2. Shared User Directory: Users are created in Keycloak and can be used in OpenCloud immediately
# because the LDAP server is connected to both Keycloak and OpenCloud.
# Only use one of the two modes at a time.

## Autoprovisioning Mode ##
# Use together with idm/external-idp.yml
# If you want to use a keycloak for local testing, you can use testing/external-keycloak.yml and testing/ldap-manager.yml
# Domain of your Identity Provider.
IDP_DOMAIN=
# IdP Issuer URL, which is used to identify the Identity Provider.
# We need the complete URL, including the protocol (http or https) and the realm.
# Example: "https://keycloak.opencloud.test/realms/openCloud"
IDP_ISSUER_URL=
# Url of the account edit page from your Identity Provider.
IDP_ACCOUNT_URL=

## Shared User Directory Mode ##
# Use together with idm/ldap-keycloak.yml and traefik/ldap-keycloak.yml
# Domain for Keycloak. Defaults to "keycloak.opencloud.test".
KEYCLOAK_DOMAIN=
# Admin user login name. Defaults to "kcadmin".
KEYCLOAK_ADMIN=
# Admin user login password. Defaults to "admin".
KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD=
# Keycloak Database username. Defaults to "keycloak".
KC_DB_USERNAME=
# Keycloak Database password. Defaults to "keycloak".
KC_DB_PASSWORD=

### Radicale Setting ###
# Radicale is a small open-source CalDAV (calendars, to-do lists) and CardDAV (contacts) server.
# When enabled OpenCloud is configured as a reverse proxy for Radicale, providing all authenticated
# OpenCloud users access to a Personal Calendar and Addressbook
# Docker image to use for the Radicale Container
RADICALE_DOCKER_IMAGE=opencloudeu/radicale
# Docker tag to pull for the Radicale Container
RADICALE_DOCKER_TAG=latest
# Define the storage location for the Radicale data. Set the path to a local path.
# Ensure that the configuration and data directories are owned by the user and group with ID 1000:1000.
# This matches the default user inside the container and avoids permission issues when accessing files.
# Leaving it default stores data in docker internal volumes.
#RADICALE_DATA_DIR=/your/local/radicale/data
```

### Start OpenCloud

```bash
docker compose up -d
docker compose logs -ft  # Follow logs
```

## Step 3: Set Up Caddy

Create `~/caddy/docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
# Caddy Docker Compose setup
services:
  caddy:
    image: caddy:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
      - "443:443/udp"
    volumes:
      - ./conf:/etc/caddy
      - ./site:/srv
      - caddy_data:/data
      - caddy_config:/config
    networks:
      - opencloud-net # Attach to the OpenCloud network

networks:
  opencloud-net: # make sure the network name matches your opencloud-compose network
    external: true
    name: opencloud-compose_opencloud-net

volumes:
  caddy_data:
  caddy_config:
```

**Note:** The external network connects Caddy to OpenCloud containers.

### Create Caddyfile

Create `~/caddy/conf/Caddyfile`:

```Caddyfile
pi.hole {
	tls internal
	reverse_proxy http://pi.hole:8080
}
cloud.opencloud.test {
	tls internal
	reverse_proxy opencloud-compose-opencloud-1:9200
}
wopiserver.opencloud.test {
	tls internal
	reverse_proxy opencloud-compose-collaboration-1:9300
}
collabora.opencloud.test {
	tls internal
	reverse_proxy opencloud-compose-collabora-1:9980
}
```

Verify container names with `docker ps` and adjust accordingly.

### Start Caddy

```bash
cd ~/caddy
docker compose up -d
```
