Deno v2 has been released! 🎉

The promo video is a must-watch:
["Deno - Programming should be simple"
on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swXWUfufu2w)

No wonder, I immediately wanted to try out Deno's new support for npm packages.
I decided to create a simple counter component using Ink, a React-like library
for building CLI apps.

Here's the code (main**.jsx**):

```jsx
// main.jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "npm:react";
import { render, Text } from "npm:ink";

const Counter = () => {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const timer = setInterval(() => {
      setCounter((previousCounter) => previousCounter + 1);
    }, 100);

    return () => {
      clearInterval(timer);
    };
  }, []);

  return <Text color="green">{counter} tests passed</Text>;
};

render(<Counter />);
```

Run the code using deno@v2.x (`Ctrl+C` to stop it 😅):

```bash
# Run the code (the first time to check permissions)
$ deno run main.jsx

# if you're fine with the permissions needed, run it again and again
$ deno run --allow-read --allow-env --allow-run main.jsx

# or compile it even 🤷‍♂️
# deno packs its runtime and the dependencies into a single executable
$ deno compile --allow-read --allow-env --allow-run main.jsx
```

Super sweet! 🍬🦕
