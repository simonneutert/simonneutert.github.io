<h1>Roda, Sequel, Rodauth</h1>

<p>For a very long time I earned my badges in the Rails Framework. From Rails 3 to Rails 4, 5 and a bit of 6 I was interested in Sinatra, the lean brother of Rails. Inspiration to a plethora of frameworks, whose goal it was to get going easy, quick and ‚Äúwith just as much as you need‚Äù.</p>

<p>So, I wrote ‚Äú<a href="https://github.com/simonneutert/sinatras-skeleton">Sinatras Skeleton</a>‚Äù as an attempt to a very basic web framework, tailored to my needs, with the gems I couldn‚Äôt live without.</p>

<p>But every time I reevaluated what‚Äôs round (Hanami was on the rise, so was Elixir and Phoenix), <a href="https://github.com/jeremyevans/roda">Roda</a> kept coming round. And after a few short lines, it got hold of me. Its creator <a href="http://jeremyevans.net">Jeremy Evans</a> has the keys to web kingdom, having released Roda, <a href="http://sequel.jeremyevans.net">Sequel</a> for Database Interaction and <a href="https://github.com/jeremyevans/rodauth">Rodauth</a> for Authentication. Rodauth brings state-of-the-art security to your authentication system, bringing all modern authentication styles as an option.</p>

<p>Roda required me to get out of my comfort zone and leave the rails I was conding on. But it offers enough comfort and sophistication you feel like inviting hackers to a BBQ if you miss something - it‚Äôs quite the other way round. Once you spent a week rolling on Roda, coding business logic is a joy.</p>

<p>My other fear was dropping ActiveRecord - I guess this is yours, too. I was so used to how it works, everything else felt clumsy. Yes, Sequel does things different and it is not ActiveRecord, but it feels good, once you give it a go. The documentation is insanely well written. And you will learn a few things about Databases ActiveRecord may have abstracted for you in the past.</p>

<p>Using Roda makes me a better programmer and I am very happy having it chosen for my current sideproject.</p>

<p>I won‚Äôt tell at this point, though üòÖ</p>
