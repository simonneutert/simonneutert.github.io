# My Personal Website

👋 Glad you found me!

This project is run using
[deno-quickblog](https://github.com/simonneutert/deno-quickblog) on a GitHub
Action and GitHub Deploy.

[deno-quickblog](https://github.com/simonneutert/deno-quickblog) is a tiny
static site generator I coded.

The blog integrated
[deno-starshower](https://github.com/simonneutert/deno-starshower) to render out
my GitHub Stars.

It is not much, but it is honest work 🧑‍🌾 🤖
