# My Personal Website

👋 Glad you found me!

This is made with:
[deno-quickblog](https://github.com/simonneutert/deno-quickblog).

[deno-quickblog](https://github.com/simonneutert/deno-quickblog) is a tiny
static site generator I spun up for bits and giggles.

A GitHub Action auto-builds this project and then hosts it on GitHub Deploy.

As a bonus [deno-starshower](https://github.com/simonneutert/deno-starshower) is
integrated. Again, run periodically in a GitHub Actions, updating the blog
content automagically.
