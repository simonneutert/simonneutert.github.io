<h1 class="rotate">üëã Hi, I'm Simon! <img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9ee19244c2d149385a7f1ca3a4844b6c?s=100" style="border-radius:5px" /></h1>

I share my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/simonneutert) and I
sometimes [blog](/posts) about what made me smile, stumble, humble, or moan.

I help maintain [shell-curry](https://shell-curry.simon-neutert.de/), an opinionated list of terminal tools.

Check out my [MicroBlog, here on the website](/microblog),  
where I collect and share links I find interesting.

My passion is Ruby, yet I enjoy exploring what other languages bring to the table.
I've been dabbling with Clojure, exploring the [land of LISP and parentheses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HM1Zb3xmvMc&t=64s) whenever I find the time ü•∞

I share my photos on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/simonneutert/).

Get in touch with me on [Telegram](https://t.me/simonneutert) or via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simon-neutert/)! üçª

## I blog from time to time

Mostly about code I've written, sometimes pet projects, or things that should never slow me down again.
That's right, I'm pointing at you, [pg gem for Mac](/2018/pg-gem-with-postgres-app-on-mac/) (though this is a thing of the past üôå)!
