description: JSON shmason... but what the ðŸ¦† is MsgPack?

So in order to get a feel for the Wunderkind in tech land, I set up a simple demo of an emitter and a consuming backend using MsgPack.

A backend serializes a tiny and a huge Ruby Hash using MsgPack. The generated code is then sent over the internets (it's someone's localhost, mine ðŸ¤«) to the requesting program, which is a simple NodeJS script https-requesting the MsgPack payload.
