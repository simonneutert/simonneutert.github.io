layout: post
---

Making Pizza is a huge deal! At least to me! And boy, am I spoiled ðŸ˜¬  
The guys from [StÃ¤dler Made](https://www.stadlermade.com/) provide excellent recipes AND OVENS!

So much so, that I was scared they change something and I am lost in the search for the recipe I got to love so much!

Having permission to have the code public from Sanne and Pieter, I am very proud to show my Clojurescript take on the recipe we ever since love so much ðŸ¥°

Project on GitHub: [pizza-dough-calculator](https://github.com/simonneutert/pizza-dough-calculator)

The scope of the app is both showing of how nice developing with Clojurescript can be.

Checking out the project can teach you:

- Clojurescript namespacing (require files and dependencies)
- Clojurescript for the Browser
- Clojures data first approach
- separation of actions and computation (immutable data)
- functional programming
- Clojurescript and testing (it's not E2E, but one could setup Jest or else)
- DOM represented as data and functions
