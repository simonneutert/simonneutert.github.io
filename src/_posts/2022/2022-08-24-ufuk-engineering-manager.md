title: Perspective of an Engineering Manager at Shopify
---

I was listening to the [Ruby on Rails Podcast #410](https://www.therubyonrailspodcast.com/410):

> Ufuk is the Engineering Manager of the Ruby Infrastructure team (Jemma's team!) at Shopify. After transitioning his career from physics to software development, Ufuk has had the fortune of working with lots of interesting technologies at various levels of the stack. He, Jemma and Brittany chat about management philosophies, why he remains excited about Ruby and what is the ideal role for Shopify in the larger Ruby ecosystem.<span>Show Notes: [The Ruby on Rails Podcast #410](https://www.therubyonrailspodcast.com/410)</span>

[Ufuk](https://twitter.com/paracycle) is aked what his Management philosophy is. Here's what I (meta-)heard him say, regarding the team and the individuals in it:

## Team Level

- the team should be able to cover all the aspects of the work that has to be done
  - one should help the team becoming skilled enough and/or being trained to solve the problems themselves
- he tries to push as much information to the team as he can, targeted to empower the team to find the best solution on its own
- he tries to enable the team to take code ownership as much as possible
  - but he still shares his (very specific and detailed) domain knowledge, when possible, so it doesn't go to waste

## Individual Level

- make the colleagues own their path of growth
- if whenever possible create opportunities helping colleagues grow (like he was guided towards his position in management)

## Philosophical thoughts

- valuing management on technical artifacts isn't possible on the management level
  - like PR, issues completed, code quality and such

Ufuk at one point says something like, that he thinks measuring success of management maybe more about the hidden "counter-"facts.  
He thinks of it as "how would it be if I wasn't here".

### Thoughts

I highly recommend this episode, because it has a nice scope on the things around us developer's desk. It can help us bridge the gap. Enabling a rewarding collaboration across roles and positions in a company/team.
