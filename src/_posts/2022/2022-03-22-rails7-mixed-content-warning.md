Upgrading to Rails v7 with esbuild wasn't a real joy.

But when in production everything went off the rails - pun intended - a `mixed active content` error had me struggling.

Thankfully it was really easy to fix, by adding: 

`<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="upgrade-insecure-requests">`

to the `application.html.erb` 😅
