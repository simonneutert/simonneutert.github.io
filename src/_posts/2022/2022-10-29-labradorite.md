title: I made my own little selfhostable flat-file notebook
layout: post

Most Notetaking apps do either too much (Notion), too less (Apple Notes) or locked me in (Evernote).

I wanted something that does **just-enough**â„¢, in the spirit of a *flat file cms*. Let me try and wrap it up in a few bullets:

* **ownership** of the notes (flat files)  
  markdown, yaml, attachments all in one place in directories
* **easy** on the eyes/mind  
  I don't want to see all the old stuff I may not need anymore
* a search that shows me **snips** in the notes  
  not just the notes in a sidebar
* a very simple **tagging** support
* basic **file uploads**  
  keeping the originals side by side with notes

I like to keep things simple, so I once again fell for [Roda](https://roda.jeremyevans.net) as the Web Layer. [Tantiny](https://github.com/baygeldin/tantiny) is the kicker for this project. I was curious, if I could come up with something useful quickly, not having to deal with a complicated setup or Postgres as a requirement.

You can find the [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/simonneutert/labradorite-notebook). Give it a spin and contribute if you are missing something.
