Newest [Watir](http://watir.com) / [Selenium](https://rubygems.org/gems/selenium-webdriver/) Combo had a deprecation warning for PhantomJS. I didn't want to get caught, so it was about time to tackle this.

Heroku is a relatively closed and proprietary PaaS, yet my favourite one. In the past, I added a compiled PhantomJS executable in a `bin` directory [(read more)](/blog/2017/scrape-js-powered-websites-with-ruby-and-selenium/).

## Buildpacks for your heroku project

go to your heroku dashboard, select the project and add these buildpacks:

* [https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-google-chrome](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-google-chrome)

* [https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-chromedriver](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-chromedriver)

but running Watir still fails:

``` ruby
# runs on local machine just fine
browser = Watir::Browser.new :chrome
```

## heroku bash to the rescue

``` bash
# in your terminal
$ cd /your/project/path

$ heroku run bash

# on heroku bash
# save the returned paths for future use
$ which google-chrome

$ which chromedriver
```

## Setup Selenium (on production)

[Selenium Chrome Documentation](http://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/rb/Selenium/WebDriver/Chrome.html)

remember to wrap the Watir code in an if clause, so only your heroku project uses the new Selenium settings. I like to set a custom ENV variable on heroku for such things.

``` ruby
Selenium::WebDriver::Chrome.path = "path/to/google-chrome"
Selenium::WebDriver::Chrome.driver_path = "path/to/chromedriver"
browser = Watir::Browser.new :chrome
```

You now have [Watir](http://watir.com) / [Selenium](https://rubygems.org/gems/selenium-webdriver/) running a headless Chrome browser on heroku.
