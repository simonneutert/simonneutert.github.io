This example only needs a list and a function to _DRY_ it all up. Depending on the expected size of the list, one could set variable that stores the count value.

``` ruby
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

def power(x)
    puts x**x
    yield if block_given?
end

arr.take(arr.count - 1).each {|x| power(x) }
# 1
# 4
# 27
# 256

power(arr.last) { puts "last element" }
# 3125
# last element
```

"What's that __yield__?", you might ask.
