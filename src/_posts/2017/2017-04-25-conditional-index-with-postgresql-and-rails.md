After listening to [Yannick Schutz - Postgresql for the ruby/rails developer @RuLu2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrjmtS59j6k) I learned about conditional indexes for the first time.

Of course [Coderwall](https://coderwall.com/p/9hxejg/advanced-rails-indexing-where-clause-postgresql) had it covered... in their example they cut query time in half.

There is absolutely no excuse for not using conditional indexes :-)
