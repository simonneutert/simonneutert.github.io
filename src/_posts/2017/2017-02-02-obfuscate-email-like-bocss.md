By utilizing css text-direction property text can be transformed into useless jibberish for crawlers and spambots.

``` css
 .obfuscate {
	  unicode-bidi: bidi-override;
	  direction: rtl;
	  text-align:left;
	  }
```

This will make the content appear reverted.

``` html
<span class="obfuscate">Hello</span>
```

"Hello" will be displayed as "olleH".

To make the text appear correct for your users, you either enter the text reversed, or make use of a programming language.

Example for Rails, output will be readable by humans as expected:

``` erb
<span class="obfuscate">
  <%= "Really sensitive data".reverse %>
</span>
```

also known as _text reverse inception_ :)
