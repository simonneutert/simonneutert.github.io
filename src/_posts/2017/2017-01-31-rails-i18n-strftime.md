[APIdock: strftime()](http://apidock.com/ruby/DateTime/strftime)

To make it short: strftime() does not translate or localize at all.

So in order to make things work in Rails, you need to use [I18n localize](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/TranslationHelper.html#method-i-localize)

I assume you've set your I18n in your rails app properly ([e.g. with this gem rails-i18n](https://github.com/svenfuchs/rails-i18n))
and the locale is __:de__

``` ruby
date = Date.new(2017,01,31)
l(date, format: "%B %Y") # => Januar 2017
```
