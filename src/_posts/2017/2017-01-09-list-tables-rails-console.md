The following Snippet will iterate over Tables and print out their total of elements
simply navigate to your rails project and run `rails c`:

``` ruby
ActiveRecord::Base.connection.tables.each do |table|
  next if table.match(/\Aschema_migrations\Z/)
  klass = table.singularize.camelize.constantize      
  puts "#{klass.name} has #{klass.count} records"
end
```
No more guesstimations ;-)
