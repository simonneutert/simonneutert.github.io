Fire up a terminal.

``` bash
diskutil list
```

Read the output carefully. You sure will identify the right device **/dev/diskX**, where **X** corresponds to the number of the device on your system. Then format it to FAT32 by typing:

``` bash
sudo diskutil eraseDisk FAT32 MYUSBDRIVENAME MBRFormat /dev/diskX
```

Easy as Pie :-)
