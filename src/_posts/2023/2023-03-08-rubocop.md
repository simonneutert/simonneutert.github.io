title: RuboCop ships with a server
---

For everybody running the standard MRI/C Ruby implementation, did you know that you can speed up your Rubocop checks by quite a bit?

> You can reduce the RuboCop boot time significantly (something like 850x faster) by using the --server command-line option.
>
> The --server option speeds up the launch of the rubocop command by utilizing a standalone server process that loads the RuboCop runtime production files (i.e. require 'rubocop').
>
> Normally RuboCop starts somewhat slowly because it needs to require a ton of files and thatâ€™s fairly slow. With the RuboCop server we sidestep this nasty issue and make it much more pleasant to interact with RuboCop from text editors and IDEs.

I recommend that you read the documentation. Please do not make the same mistake I did!

Make sure to add a `.rubocop` file to your project, but this time **without the `.yml`** ending!

```sh
# content of .rubocop
--server
```
