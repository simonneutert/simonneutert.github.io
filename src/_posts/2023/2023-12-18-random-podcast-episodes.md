title: "Elevate Your Podcast Experience: Using Apple Shortcuts to Play Random Episodes (and NGINX)"
---

Podcasts have become an integral part of my daily routine, and accessing them seamlessly is crucial for a smooth listening experience. In this guide, I'll explore how you can leverage Nginx to offer a JSON file containing links to podcast episodes.

Additionally, I'll demonstrate how iPhone users can use the Shortcuts app to load the JSON file, extract a random entry, and open the URL for their preferred podcast service.

## The following is one of many ways / tldr

It's up to you as a user or the podcaster to host your episodes in a way that allows you to access them via a JSON file. Then load this via the **Shortcut** app and use the **Get Dictionary Value** action to extract a random entry from the JSON file. Finally, use the **Open URLs** action to open the URL in your preferred podcast app.

**The following code will be pseudo code and just guide you a little.**

### Setting Up Nginx to Serve JSON

Nginx is a powerful web server that can be used to serve static files, including JSON. Here's a quick example of an Nginx configuration to serve a podcast.json file:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    location /podcasts {
        alias /path/to/your/json/files;
        index podcast.json;
    }
}
```

Replace yourdomain.com with your actual domain and adjust the path accordingly. Make sure the JSON file contains an array of podcast entries, each with a title and url pointing to the podcast episode.

### Creating the Podcast JSON File

Here's an example of how your podcast.json file might look:

```json
[
    {
        "title": "Podcast Episode 1",
        "url": "https://spotify.com/episode1"
    },
    {
        "title": "Podcast Episode 2",
        "url": "https://applepodcasts.com/episode2"
    },
    // Add more entries as needed
]
```

An Array of objects.

#### Using Shortcuts on iPhone

1. Get the [Shortcuts app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id915249334) from the App Store.
2. Setup a new shortcut

Then, add the following actions to your shortcut:

1. Get contents of `https://yourdomain.com/podcasts/podcast.json`
2. Get `Random Item` from `Get Contents of URL`
3. Get `Dictionary` from `Item from List`
4. Get `Random Item` from `Dictionary`
5. Get `Value` for `your-key-in-the-json` from `Dictionary`
6. Open `Dictionary Value`
