To get things going with e.g. [Vue(-cli)](https://cli.vuejs.org) development, you took the steps in the guide.But your system (using zsh) won't run the executable, then open where your init takes place, which is most likely `/home/<usernname>/.zshrc`.

Append the folling to the end:

``` sh
export PATH="$(yarn global bin):$PATH"
```

save and restart your terminals.
