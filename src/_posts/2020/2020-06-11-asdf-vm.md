## Manage software language versions with ease

asdf is now known as asdf-vm (asdf version manager) and you can check the [website](https://asdf-vm.com/#/) or jump to the [code base on GitHub](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf).

### asdf-vm cheatsheet

with Ruby as an example:

```
$ asdf plugin add ruby
$ asdf list all ruby
$ asdf install ruby 2.6.6
$ asdf list ruby

# Set Current Version
#
# global overwrite with this command, but please do this only if you know what consequences it brings.
# global writes the version to $HOME/.tool-versions.
# $ asdf global <name> <version> [<version>...]
# 
# set the ruby version for a project:
# local writes the version to $PWD/.tool-versions, creating it if needed.
$ asdf local <name> <version> [<version>...]
```

## Installation and system integration

It is installed really quick and will do all the hustle for you. User of Mac OS Catalina which comes with `zsh` as the default shell will most likely use oh-my-zsh and all you need to do is enable the plugin.

But it works just as well with bash or fish.

`$ vi ~/.zshrc`

Here are the plugins I load:

```
# Which plugins would you like to load?
# Standard plugins can be found in $ZSH/plugins/
# Custom plugins may be added to $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/
# Example format: plugins=(rails git textmate ruby lighthouse)
# Add wisely, as too many plugins slow down shell startup.
plugins=(git bundler dotenv osx rake ruby asdf docker docker-compose yarn npm)
```

## asdf-vm and nodejs

when it comes to installing nodejs, there might be an error, which is easily fixed by hacking this into your terminal:

`bash ~/.asdf/plugins/nodejs/bin/import-release-team-keyring`
