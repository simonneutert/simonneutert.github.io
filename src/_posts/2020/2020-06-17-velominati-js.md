If you are a true cyclist, all your wishes came true.

If you never heard of the Velominati, but ride a road bike? Get yourself together:

> We are the Keepers of the Cog. In so being, we also maintain the sacred text wherein lie the simple truths of cycling etiquette known as _**The Rules**_. It is in our trust to maintain and endorse this list.  
> __*The Rules*__ lie at the beginning of The Path to __*La Vie Velominatus*__, not at the end; learning to balance them against one another and to welcome them all into your life as a Velominatus is a never-ending struggle waged between form and function as we continue along The Path towards transcension.

Now, you can learn all rules and learn Javascript at the same time.
