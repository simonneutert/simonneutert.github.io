After struggling for some time with getting grip of lisp, I finally took the time and doodled a bit.

Check out [ClojureScript PizzaPi on GitHub](https://github.com/simonneutert/pizza-pi-clojurescript-reframe)!

As you can imagine, this is another version of my infamous Pizza Pi Calculator!

After Vue, Svelte and Elm, now ClojureScript. This is a really refreshing way of coding ðŸ¥°
