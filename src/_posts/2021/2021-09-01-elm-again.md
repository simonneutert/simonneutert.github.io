After getting my hands dirty with Clojure, I felt like I had to give Elm ðŸŒ³ another shot.

And, to be honest, it starts to grow on me! Pun intended.

Why, well, one of my early days Vue projects rendered itself unmaintainable. The effort it would take to update the dependencies of "vue/cli" is unbearable, so I just kept the components and started it from scratch - meh!

This was what motivated me, to see how my elm project had aged. It aged very well, the tooling got better, the language and framework did not change.
