It took me quite some nerves, because Spotify made a zero effort attempt linking audio books and plays.

## get the source data from the API

- make dev account for api access on spotify
- visit https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/albums/get-several-albums/ then scroll around until you find the "try it" button, it will generate a key, which in turn allows you to curl what you need (pipe to file ðŸ˜‰)
- extract json using JSONata

## JSONata

I always wondered how on earth I could put JSONata to use.

> Lightweight query and transformation language for JSON data
> Inspired by the location path semantics of XPath 3.1
> Sophisticated query expressions with minimal syntax
> Built in operators and functions for manipulating and combining data
> Create user-defined functions
> Format query results into any JSON output structure

#### JSONata Example for Sherlock Holmes (German)

``` json
{
    "items": $sort(items[$contains(name, 'Die Originale')].{
        "name": name,
        "uri": uri,
        "images": images,
        "spotifyUrl": external_urls.spotify,
        "case": $number($split($match(name, /[Folge|Fall] \d+/).match, " ")[-1])
    }, function($l, $r) {
        $l.case > $r.case
    }
    )
}
```

### Code / Result

Here's what I smashed together in two very simple NuxtJS apps.
