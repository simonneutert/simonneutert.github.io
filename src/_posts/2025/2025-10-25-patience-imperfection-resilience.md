title: "On Patience, Imperfection, and Resilience"
---

To me, quality-focused work requires patience, acceptance of imperfection, and fostering resilience.

**A note on cultural concepts:** The following interpretations are my personal understanding of these philosophies as they might apply to software development. These are complex cultural concepts with deep histories that I'm respectfully adapting, not claiming to represent authoritatively. If you're interested in the full cultural context, I encourage you to explore these traditions in depth.

### Itutu: The Art of Patience and Humility

**Itutu** is a concept from Yoruba philosophy (West African tradition) that roughly translates to "coolness of character"—embodying patience, humility, and emotional balance.[A West African Philosophy of Calm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKhZxytNbc) on YouTube is a good place to start, if you like to get a sense of it. What follows is my interpretation of how these principles might inform our approach to work:

**Not reacting, but responding thoughtfully.** That bug that just broke production? Panic won't fix it faster. A cool head will.

**Recognizing you don't have all the answers.** And that's okay. Some of the best solutions come from admitting "I'm stuck" and asking for help.

**Playing the long game.** Not every PR needs to be merged today. Not every feature needs to be in this sprint. Good work takes time.

### Wabi-Sabi: Embracing Imperfection and Transience

**Wabi-Sabi** is a central concept in Japanese aesthetics and philosophy that finds beauty in imperfection, impermanence, and incompleteness. Rooted in Zen Buddhist teachings, it represents a worldview quite different from Western perfectionism. Here's how I interpret its principles for software development:

**Your code will never be perfect.** And that's fine. Ship it, learn from it, improve it. Perfection is the enemy of done.

**Everything is temporary.** That architecture you spent months designing? It'll be rewritten in a few years. The framework you're learning? It'll be replaced. Design for change, not permanence.

**Imperfections tell a story.** That hacky workaround you implemented at 2 AM before a launch? It's part of the journey. Document it, learn from it, but don't beat yourself up over it.

### SISU: Finnish Resilience and Process Thinking

**SISU** (pronounced "see-su") is a uniquely Finnish concept that roughly translates to resilience, grit, and endurance. Here's my understanding of how it translates to software culture as a **debugging philosophy**. While Silicon Valley celebrates "move fast and break things," this approach asks: "Cool, but maybe stop breaking them in the first place?"

When something crashes, Finnish teams don't rush to patch the symptom. They practice the **Three W's**:

1. **What failed?** (Identify the symptom)
2. **Why did it fail?** (Understand the root cause)
3. **Where in the process** do we need to improve? (Find the systemic issue)

Then—and this is key—they **fix the process, not just the bug**. Your goal must be, to not let the same mistake happen again.

I've lived that nightmare: production bug we "temporarily" patched to save a demo. Later that year, that same patch drove me nuts for a week.

Next time something breaks (and something will break):

**Don't:**
- ❌ Immediately **hotfix** the symptom
- ❌ Blame the person who wrote the code
- ❌ Move on once it's "working"

**Do:**
1. ✅ Fix the immediate issue (yes, ship the hotfix)
2. ✅ Schedule 30 minutes for the Three W's:
   - What failed?
   - Why did it fail?
   - Where in our process did we miss this?
3. ✅ Create a ticket to fix the *process* (add a test, improve CI, update docs)
4. ✅ Actually do that ticket within the next cycle

This is how you stop fighting the same fires. Every day a little better.
