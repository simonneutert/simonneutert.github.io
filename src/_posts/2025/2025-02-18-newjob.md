Starting a new job as a developer is a mix of excitement and uncertainty. You’re
stepping into a new environment, meeting new people, and learning a whole new
set of tools and processes. But no matter where you go, some things remain
constant—and keeping them in mind can make your transition smoother.

### Get to Know Your Team

Your colleagues will be your greatest resource, so start by building
connections. Observe how they collaborate, participate in **code reviews** to
understand their coding style, and try **pair programming** to learn faster and
build trust.

- Ask someone if you can sit with them for an hour as a second pair of eyes.
  It’s a great way to learn, and hey, you can always offer to grab some coffee
  or snacks in return!

### Understand the Organizational Structure

Figuring out where things are stored and how knowledge is shared will save you
from unnecessary headaches.

- Locate **important documents**—whether they’re in a shared drive, an internal
  Wiki, or a NAS.
  - Where is everything, and who maintains it?
- **Knowledge Management:** Explore documentation related to the product.
  - Can you contribute or improve it?
  - If there's an **onboarding guide**, update it if needed—or create one if
    it’s missing.

### Get a Feel for Communication Tools

Every team has its own way of communicating. Some prefer async messages, while
others rely on real-time chat.

- Pay attention to how your team uses **Slack, Teams, or other chat
  systems**—when do they expect quick replies, and when is async okay?
- Figure out meeting norms—do they lean on standups, or are emails the go-to?

### Learn from Recent Newcomers

New hires from the past few months are goldmines of information—they just went
through what you’re experiencing.

- Reach out to the **last developer who joined**—they’ll remember the struggles
  and can share useful tips.
- Keep an eye out for the next person who joins after you. One day, you’ll be in
  a position to make their onboarding easier.

### Ask Questions—Seriously, Just Ask

No one expects you to know everything on day one (or even month one). It's
better to ask than to silently struggle.

- Your team might assume you already know things that you don’t—clarifying
  doubts early can save everyone time.
- In a healthy team, no one expects you to perform miracles ever.

### Improve Documentation as You Go

Most teams struggle with documentation. If something isn’t clear, take notes,
ask questions, and help improve it.

- If something took you an hour to figure out, document it—it might save the
  next person hours.

### Socialize and Build Relationships

Work is about people as much as it is about code. Even if you’re introverted,
making an effort to connect can make work more enjoyable.

- Have lunch with your colleagues—no pressure to do it daily, but occasional
  check-ins help.
- Be a little chatty—share your hobbies, ask about theirs. It’s the small things
  that build connections.
- Join internal groups or social events. Even virtual hangouts can help you feel
  more at home.

### Set Up Your Development Environment

The sooner you get your tools and workflow running smoothly, the sooner you’ll
feel productive.

- Make sure you have access to **repositories, credentials, and development
  tools**.
- If the setup process is long, automate parts of it or update the documentation
  for the next person.

### Understand the Development Workflow

Every company has its own way of doing things. Learning the workflow early will
help you contribute faster.

- Figure out the **version control strategy** (Git flow, trunk-based
  development, etc.).
- Get familiar with **CI/CD pipelines**—how code gets tested, built, and
  deployed.
- Learn about **branching and merging policies** to avoid conflicts.

### Identify Key People

Understanding who makes decisions and who can help will save you time.

- Get to know the **product owner, tech lead, and key stakeholders**.
- Understand what they expect and how they define success.

### Understand Project History

Before refactoring or making changes, it helps to understand why things are the
way they are.

- Look into past decisions—who made them and why? It’ll save you from repeating
  mistakes or making assumptions.

### Start Small, Then Contribute Bigger

Ease into the codebase by tackling smaller tasks before diving into complex
features.

- Begin with **low-risk tasks** like bug fixes or small improvements to
  understand the codebase.
- Once comfortable, take on bigger features or suggest improvements.

### Give Yourself Time

Even if you’ve changed jobs before, every new team has a learning curve. Be
patient with yourself—no one expects you to have everything figured out
instantly. The most important thing? Stay curious, keep learning, and don’t be
afraid to ask for help.
