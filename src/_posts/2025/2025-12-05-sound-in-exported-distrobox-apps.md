You're an avid Distrobox user, but after exporting your favourite browser, there no sound 😿

You need to support Pulse Audio!

> Pavucontrol is the gold-standard for managing the Pulse Audio sound server on Linux. Despite this, it’s not the default sound manager tool on mainstream Linux distributions. As a result, before we can continue with this tutorial, we’ll need to go over how to install the Pavucontrol audio manager.

> To install Pavucontrol, launch a terminal window and follow the instructions that correspond with your Linux operating system.

I will use Debian for demonstration, so you'll find your package - I am sure!

Install the GTK version:

`sudo apt-get install pavucontrol`

And for QT install:

`sudo apt-get install pavucontrol-qt`

After installing Mariah Carey was blasting out loud on the speakers.
