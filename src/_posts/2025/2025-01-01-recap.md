2024 had its ups and downs. I've been working on a lot of different projects, some of them are public, some of them are private. I've learned a lot about different technologies and programming languages. I've been experimenting with different runtimes and I've been contributing to open source projects.

Overall I'm happy with the progress I made. I've made some new friends along the way and I've been able to help out in a few projects.

## Programming Languages

Languages used:

- Ruby
- JavaScript
- Clojure / Babashka
- TypeScript (new)
- Java (new)
- Go (new)

_JavaScript Bonus:_ experimenting with JavaScript runtimes played a huge part this year:

- Deno (is what we've all been waiting for)
- Bun (is really cool, too)

## Public Projects

Here are the projects I've shoved into existence this year:

### Shell-Curry (Ruby & Jekyll)

[shell-curry](https://shell-curry.simon-neutert.de/) is a curated list of shell tools and configurations. The main goal is to provide a curated list of shell tools and configurations that we use in our daily work.

### Picnic-Auth (TypeScript@Deno)

[picnic-auth](https://github.com/simonneutert/picnic-auth) is a simple authentication service that uses JWTs and BCrypt to authenticate users from an env file.

### Wilson (TypeScript@Deno)

[wilson](https://github.com/simonneutert/wilson) is a glorified OpenAI Client, that works with recipe/form files to interact with threaded/multistep OpenAI Assistants. User Input via CLI.

### Unreachable Tiles Map Editor (JavaScript@Deno)

[unreachable_tiles_map_editor](https://github.com/simonneutert/unreachable_tiles_map_editor) is a simple web interface to interact with a map, in order to mark tiles as unreachable.

### Deno Garmin JS SDK to JSON (Deno in Docker)

[deno-garmin-js-sdk-to-json](https://github.com/simonneutert/deno-garmin-js-sdk-to-json) is a compilable Deno wrapper around the Garmin JS SDK to extract JSON data from .fit files.

### Strava Export Organizer Web w/ CLI (Ruby & Go)

[strava-export-organizer-web](https://github.com/simonneutert/strava-export-organizer-web) is a web interface for the Strava Export Organizer. The project pulls in [strava-export-organizer](https://github.com/simonneutert/strava-export-organizer), a CLI tool written in Go to organize Strava Exports into a structured folder hierarchy.

### Java Map Tile Metrics w/ CLI (Java)

[java-map-tile-metrics](https://github.com/simonneutert/java-map-tile-metrics) and [java-map-tile-metrics-cli](https://github.com/simonneutert/java-map-tile-metrics-cli) are Java implementations of the map tile metrics calculation. A score of a user's visited places on a map.

### BB Map Tile Metrics w/ CLI (babashka)

[bb-map-tile-metrics](https://github.com/simonneutert/bb-map-tile-metrics) a Babashka (Clojure/Lisp) implementation of the map tile metrics calculation.

## Revisited Public Projects

Some projects have been revisited and improved:

### Shuffle-GAG (babashka)

[shuffle-gag](https://github.com/simonneutert/shuffle-gag) is a github action based podcast scraper written in Babashka.

### Git-Hire, hire on fire ðŸ”¥ (babashka)

[git-hire](https://github.com/simonneutert/git-hire) a Babashka (Clojure/Lisp) to API scrape GitHub for users with a certain skillset in a certain location.

### Ruby Telegram Login Web Stub Tutorial (Ruby)

[ruby-telegram-login-web-stub-tutorial](https://github.com/simonneutert/ruby-telegram-login-web-stub-tutorial) a ruby implementation of the Telegram Web-Login.

### Pizza Dough Calculator (ClojureScript)

[Pizza Dough Calculator](https://github.com/simonneutert/pizza-dough-calculator) a ClojureScript implementation of a pizza dough calculator.

## Topics and Learnings in Private and Public Projects

Every project I've worked on this year has taught me something new. Here are some of the topics I've been dealing with:

- VPS Server Setup
- Caddy
- intensive use of justfiles
- document my ideas, urls, decisions, and thoughts in _readme.**topic**.md_ files
- Prompt Engineering
  - side effect: dealing/interacting with AIs had an impact on my documentation/communication for sure
- a glimpse into MongoDB (with Go)
- Git Submodules (no conclusions yet)
- Systemd
- Ruby stuff:
  - a medium sized app with Roda, Rodauth, htmx and Postgres via Sequel
    - Sequel: Postgres can stream results ðŸš€
  - Passenger vs Puma (Ruby Webservers)
  - Honeybadger vs Sentry (Ruby Webservers)
  - YJIT config for production
  - jemalloc2 and ruby
- Much higher performance when the web server is setup using a socket NOT TCP 
- GHCR (GitHub Container Registry)
- Traefik and cron jobbed deploys from GHCR.io
- (p)React.js
- Deno compile
- Deno test
- e2e with playwright using github workflows
- some bugs can be fixed by upcasing the first letter of a string (roda-i18n) ðŸ˜…
- Github Workflows

## Open Source Contributions

I contributed to the following projects (hope I didn't forget any):

- [strava-ruby-client](https://github.com/dblock/strava-ruby-client) (co-mainainer) by [@dblock](https://github.com/dblock)
- [roda-i18n](https://github.com/kematzy/roda-i18n) (co-mainainer) by [@kematzy](https://github.com/kematzy)
- [strzibny/invoice_printer](https://github.com/strzibny/invoice_printer/pulls) by [@strzibny](https://github.com/strzibny)
- [wieczos-virus-scanner](https://github.com/wieczo/wieczos-virus-scanner) by [@wieczo](https://github.com/wieczo)
- [scittle-tiny-slides](https://github.com/chr15m/scittle-tiny-slides) by [@chr15m](https://github.com/chr15m)
- [r18n-core](https://github.com/r18n/r18n-core)

## Anything else?

Year, I learnt [How Drum and Bass is made...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsKKf-WNtdI) on YouTube.
