title: "bb-maid Gets a Major UX Upgrade: Install via bbin, Tab Completion and Cleaner Commands"
---

Tonight was one of those productive coding sessions where small improvements snowball into something really polished. I've been working on [bb-maid](https://github.com/simonneutert/bb-maid), a Babashka script that helps keep directories clean by automatically removing expired folders, and we made some significant UX improvements that I'm excited to share.

## What is bb-maid?

Before diving into the changes, let me quickly introduce bb-maid. It's a Babashka script that works like a "digital housekeeper" for your filesystem. You create files named `cleanup-maid-YYYY-MM-DD` in directories you want to expire, and bb-maid will prompt you to delete those directories once the date passes. Think of it like expiration labels on food containers, but for your code directories.

## The Journey: From Working to Delightful

### Phase 1: Making it bbin-Compatible

The next challenge was making bb-maid installable via [bbin](https://github.com/babashka/bbin), Babashka's script manager. This required some structural changes:

**Created proper namespace structure:**
```clojure
;; src/simonneutert/bb_maid.clj
(ns simonneutert.bb-maid
  (:require [bling.core :refer [bling callout]]
            [babashka.fs :as fs]))

(defn -main [& args]
  ;; Command handling
  )
```

**Added dependency management:**
```clojure
;; deps.edn
{:paths ["src"]
 :deps {io.github.paintparty/bling {:mvn/version "0.4.2"}}}
```

**Configured bbin entry point:**
```clojure
;; bb.edn
{:bbin/bin {bb-maid {:main-opts ["-m" "simonneutert.bb-maid"]}}}
```

Now users can install with a single command:
```bash
bbin install io.github.simonneutert/bb-maid
```

### Phase 2: Adding the `clean-in` Command

The first improvement was adding a `clean-in` command to make it easier to create cleanup files:

```bash
bb-maid clean-in 7d
```

This parses duration strings (like `7d`, `30d`, `90d`) and creates a `cleanup-maid-YYYY-MM-DD` file with the appropriate expiration date. No more manual date calculations!

**Key features:**
- Natural duration syntax (`1d`, `7d`, `30d`, etc.)
- Automatically replaces existing cleanup files (preventing duplicates)
- Styled terminal output using the [bling](https://github.com/paintparty/bling) library

### Phase 3: Adding Professional Tab Completion

This was the big one. Modern CLI tools need great tab completion, and we added support for both **zsh** and **bash**.

#### The Tab Completion Challenge

The first attempt had the completion file named `bb-maid.zsh`, but zsh wasn't loading it. After some debugging, I discovered that **zsh completion functions must be named with an underscore prefix** (e.g., `_bb-maid`). This is a zsh convention that tells the completion system to auto-load the function.

#### What Gets Completed

The completion system is context-aware:

- `bb-maid <TAB>` → Shows `clean` and `clean-in` commands
- `bb-maid clean <TAB>` → Shows available directories
- `bb-maid clean-in <TAB>` → Suggests common durations (1d, 7d, 14d, 30d, 60d, 90d)

### Phase 4: Cleaning Up the Command Structure

The final improvement was prompted by a great question: "Wouldn't `bb-maid clean /path/to/dir` be cleaner?"

Absolutely! The original API was:
```bash
bb-maid /path/to/dir        # Implicit clean command
bb-maid clean-in 7d         # Explicit command
```

This inconsistency was confusing. Now it's:
```bash
bb-maid clean /path/to/dir  # Explicit clean command
bb-maid clean-in 7d         # Explicit command
```

Much more intuitive and consistent with modern CLI conventions!

## Technical Lessons Learned

### 1. Zsh Completion Naming Convention
Completion files **must** start with an underscore (`_bb-maid`) for auto-loading to work. This is a zsh convention that's easy to miss if you're new to writing completions.

### 2. Glob Qualifiers for Robust Paths
Using `(N)` in zsh glob patterns makes them optional:
```bash
fpath=(~/.gitlibs/*/completions(N) $fpath)
```
Without `(N)`, zsh will error if the path doesn't exist yet.

### 3. bbin Requires Proper Structure
For bbin compatibility, you need:
- A `deps.edn` with dependencies
- Proper namespace structure with `-main` function
- `:bbin/bin` configuration in `bb.edn`
- Java/JDK for dependency resolution

### 4. Context-Aware Completion is Delightful
Taking the time to make completion suggestions contextual (directories after `clean`, durations after `clean-in`) makes the tool feel polished and professional.
