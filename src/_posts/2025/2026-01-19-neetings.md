[I wanted to open source it one day](https://www.simon-neutert.de/2025/neetings/),\
and that day is today! 🎉\
(I finally found the courage to simply put it out there.)

> [neetings](https://www.neetings.com) is a meeting notes app I built over the

> uses smart block types and Kanban-style organization to turn messy notes into
> actionable content.

Everybody and their dog was/is/loves/hates vibe-coding these days.\
I wanted to know what the fuss was about. And, boy, do I know now.

**The feeling is bittersweet**: I'm excited to share the project and see if others
find it useful — the product likely wouldn't exist without AI assistance. At
the same time, I can't maintain it alone without additional help or more AI.

Because it's 99% AI-generated (mostly Claude Code), I don't feel confident
supporting it long-term. Maybe someone else will find it useful or build on it
— let's do it together! Together, we might truly own the software someday. 🤞

Being React-based, it should be fairly straightforward to adapt or extend.

Of course, there are still some improvements I want to make, like:

- "@mentions" for attendees
- a few more keyboard shortcuts

For now, I’m happy to share the code with you all.  
Time to move on to new things. 🚀
