## A Note on Code Reviews

Let's be honest: we've all written code that made us cringe months later. Whether you're a junior developer or a seasoned architect, nobody writes perfect code all the time. That's exactly why code reviews exist â€“ not as a platform for showing off or criticizing others, but as a collaborative tool for improvement. When reviewing code, remember to be direct but polite; we're all in this together, trying to build better software.

## The 10 Commandments of Code Review

1. **Thou shalt ensure readability**, for confusing code is the Devil's Playground.

2. **Thou shalt consider performance and scalability**, for slow code is an Abomination.

3. **Thou shalt stay within scope**, and not add unnecessary complexity.

4. **Thou shalt check for edge cases**, for the unexpected shall smite thee in production.

5. **Thou shalt not forget test coverage**, for untested code is a sin in the eyes of QA.

6. **Thou shalt seek out repetitive code** and banish it from the codebase.

7. **Thou shalt not nitpick**, lest you be smited by thine own pet peeves.

8. **Thou shalt provide constructive feedback** and sing praises of good code.

9. **Thou shalt encourage discussion**, for two minds are mightier than one.

10. **Thou shalt not block changes over minor issues**, for Perfection is a false idol.

### 1. Ensure Readability

Code should be easily understood by others. Look for clear naming conventions, appropriate comments, and well-structured functions. If you need to read the same code multiple times to understand it, suggest improvements in organization or clarity.

### 2. Consider Performance

Watch for potential bottlenecks and inefficient code. Look for opportunities to optimize, such as early returns and proper algorithmic complexity. Remember: what works on your computer might not scale well on servers.

### 3. Stay Within Scope

Understand the problem being solved and avoid suggesting changes that don't align with the ticket's purpose. Save broader improvements for separate tickets and discussions.

### 4. Check Edge Cases

Review how the code handles unexpected scenarios, including empty arrays, null values, and missing data. Border cases often cause the most problems in production.

### 5. Verify Test Coverage

Ensure adequate testing, especially for critical functionality. Tests should be comprehensive, well-structured, and actually useful â€“ not redundant. Don't demand tests for trivial changes.

### 6. Eliminate Code Duplication

Look for repeated code blocks and suggest abstractions to improve maintainability. If the same intensive operation happens multiple times, consider caching results when appropriate.

### 7. Avoid Nitpicking

Don't get hung up on trivial formatting preferences or subjective matters. You're not a linter â€“ focus on what truly matters.

### 8. Provide Constructive Feedback

Frame suggestions positively and acknowledge good work. Instead of "this is poorly written," try "consider refactoring this for clarity ðŸ˜Š"

### 9. Encourage Discussion

Foster collaboration and open dialogue. For complex issues, take the discussion offline to voice or chat channels where ideas can flow more naturally.

### 10. Don't Block on Minor Issues

Differentiate between essential fixes and nice-to-haves. Not every suggestion needs to be implemented before merging.

Remember: Perfect is the enemy of good. Sometimes "good enough" is exactly what the project needs at that moment.
