<p>Recently, I released the project <a href="https://github.com/simonneutert/github-api-monitor">github-api-monitor</a>. I built this tool because, while working with the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/rest/using-the-rest-api/rate-limits-for-the-rest-api?apiVersion=2022-11-28">GitHub REST API</a>, I kept running into rate limits (not often, but it happened).</p>

<p>With this monitor, you can easily keep track of your current limits and better plan when and how many API requests are possible. The project is open source—feel free to try it out or contribute!</p>

<h2 id="my-objective-learning-more-about-shell-scripting">My Objective: Learning More About Shell Scripting</h2>

<p>One of my main objectives with this project was to deepen my understanding of shell environments—especially Bash, Zsh, and Fish. I wanted to explore how to solve real-world problems using scripting languages, while staying POSIX compliant where needed. This approach ensures that the scripts remain portable and usable across different systems and shells.</p>

<p>By working on github-api-monitor, I was able to experiment with various shell features, learn about their differences, and practice writing robust, maintainable scripts. If you’re interested in shell scripting or want to see practical examples, this project might be a good starting point.</p>
