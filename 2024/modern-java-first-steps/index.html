<h1>Getting my feet wet with modern Java.</h1>

<p>Java has been getting a lot of positive attention lately, and I wanted to see what all the excitement was about. As a long-time Rubyist, I&#8217;ve been spoiled by Ruby&#8217;s vibrant community and user-friendly ecosystem. So, how would modern Java measure up?</p>

<p>In Uni Java felt super alien and the introduction to coding was a bit rough. So in a sense Java was the reason why I didn&#8217;t pursue becoming a software engineer. But now, with a few years of coding experience under my belt, I wanted to give it another shot.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Installation was a breeze using ASDF.</li>
  <li>Startup time is no issue (to me).</li>
  <li>The classic &#8220;Hello World&#8221; program? Done in no time!</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="the-build-tool-dilemma-maven-vs-ant-vs-gradle">The Build Tool Dilemma: Maven vs Ant vs Gradle</h2>

<p>Here&#8217;s where things got interesting. In a previous project, I had used Maven with simple commands like: <code class="highlighter-rouge">mvn clean install</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">mvn spring-boot:run</code> - that&#8217;s about it.</p>

<p>This time, after some research, I decided to try Gradle, which seemed to be the most modern option.</p>

<h2 id="diving-in-a-simple-algorithm-implementation">Diving In: A Simple Algorithm Implementation</h2>

<p>I started with <code class="highlighter-rouge">gradle init</code> and chose the Java library option. To help me along, I used GitHub Copilot as a tutor, asking questions like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>&#8220;When would I use static, public?&#8221;</li>
  <li>&#8220;What is a bean and is this class a bean?&#8221;</li>
</ul>

<p>(#JuniorForever, am I right?)</p>

<h2 id="the-java-experience">The Java Experience</h2>

<p>Despite some initial hurdles, I found the experience quite pleasant:</p>

<ol>
  <li>With Copilot as my rubber duck / passive colleague, I got the code to compile and run.</li>
  <li>Types were challenging at first, but I adapted quickly.</li>
  <li>I really enjoyed working with the Stream API.</li>
  <li>Using HashSets and HashMaps instead of creating classes for everything felt lightweight and modern.</li>
</ol>

<p>While the keywords, syntax and types took (and will take) some getting used to, I eventually got everything working smoothly.</p>

<h2 id="the-result">The Result</h2>

<p>You can check out my first two Java projects here:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/simonneutert/java-map-tile-metrics">Map Tile Metrics Library</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/simonneutert/java-map-tile-metrics-cli">Map Tile Metrics CLI</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, my journey into Java was a nice experience. While it has its own learning curve, I can see why it&#8217;s receiving good press. Have you tried stepping out of your programming comfort zone lately?</p>
